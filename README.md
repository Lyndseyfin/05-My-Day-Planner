# 05-My-Day-Planner

-Fifth Assignment

## HTML, jQuery, Javascript + CSS

- I created a day planner using HTML, moment.js, jQuery and Javascript styled with CSS.
- User will be able to input notes in each hour between 9AM-5PM dependent on their needs.
- The planner is color-coated by time-past, present, and future. Gray = past, pink = present, green = future.
- Data will store when refreshed so the planner is kept up for the day.
